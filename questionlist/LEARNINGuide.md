Nice — smart move. I’ll apply the **Pareto 80/20** thinking: pick the \~20% of topics/problems that give you \~80% of interview success. Below I give a **high-impact shortlist**, the **techniques each one teaches**, a **practical fast plan** (how to train fast), and **metrics** so you know when you’re ready.

# 1) The core idea (80/20)

Spend most of your effort on a *small set of patterns* that keep reappearing in OAs and interviews:

* Arrays & Strings (two-pointers, sliding window, prefix/suffix)
* Hashmaps / Frequency counting
* Two-pointers / sorting tricks
* Monotonic deque / stack patterns
* Linked lists basics + design patterns (LRU)
* Binary search variants
* Heaps (kth/median) + intervals/greedy
* Core DP primitives (1D DP, knapsack style)
  If you master these, you’ll be able to quickly adapt to most Amazon intern problems and many FAANG problems.

# 2) Top **20 highest-ROI problems** (master these first)

Solve and deeply *understand* these — they unlock many variants. (LeetCode # in parentheses)

1. Two Sum (#1) — hashmap pattern
2. Product of Array Except Self (#238) — prefix/suffix trick
3. Maximum Subarray (#53) — Kadane (greedy/DP)
4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock I (#121) — one-pass greedy
5. Trapping Rain Water (#42) — two-pointer / elevation trick
6. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (#3) — sliding window
7. Minimum Window Substring (#76) — advanced sliding window + freq table
8. Group Anagrams (#49) — hashing + canonical keys
9. 3Sum (#15) — sorting + two pointers
10. Container With Most Water (#11) — two-pointer greedy
11. Sliding Window Maximum (#239) — monotonic deque
12. Minimum Size Subarray Sum (#209) — sliding window (variable window)
13. Valid Parentheses (#20) — stack fundamentals
14. Min Stack (#155) — stack + design trick
15. Daily Temperatures (#739) — monotonic stack pattern
16. Linked List Cycle (#141) — fast/slow pointers
17. Merge Two Sorted Lists (#21) — linked-list merging & dummy node
18. Add Two Numbers (#2) — list arithmetic (carries)
19. LRU Cache (#146) — design (hashmap + double linked list)
20. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (#4) — binary search on partitions (advanced binary search)

These 20 cover: arrays/strings, sliding windows, two pointers, stacks/monotonic patterns, linked lists, heaps/medians (via #4 idea), hashing, basic design, and a core DP/greedy.

# 3) High-value **next 10** (after above)

Add these once the 20 feel comfortable (still high ROI):

* Kth Largest Element (#215) — heap practice
* Merge Intervals (#56) / Non-overlapping Intervals (#435) — intervals & greedy
* Gas Station (#134) — greedy / cycle detection
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (#300) — DP / patience sorting
* Coin Change (#322) — DP knapsack form
* Search in Rotated Sorted Array (#33) — binary search variant
* Word Break (#139) — DP + BFS on strings
* Generate Parentheses (#22) — backtracking template
* Edit Distance (#72) — classic string DP (stretch)
* Daily OA practice: HackerRank timed problems (not a problem number)

---

# 4) Techniques mapping (so you practice by pattern)

Practice these patterns, not random problems:

* Two pointers: 3Sum, Container With Most Water, Remove duplicates, Rotate
* Sliding window: Longest substring, Min window, Min size subarray
* Monotonic stack/deque: Sliding Window Max, Daily Temperatures
* Hashmap patterns: Two Sum, Group Anagrams, Subarray Sum equals K
* Binary search: Median of two arrays, Rotated array variants, find bounds
* Heap: Kth largest, merging k lists, streaming median
* Linked list fundamentals: cycle, reverse, merge, add
* DP (1D → 2D): Climbing Stairs → Coin Change / LIS → Edit Distance
* Design: LRU Cache, Trie basics

---

# 5) Concrete **4-week fast plan** (Pareto schedule)

Goal: be OA/interview-ready fast. This assumes daily practice (\~1.5–2.5 hours/day). Adjust to your time.

Week 1 — Foundation (Arrays + Strings + Two-pointers)

* Days 1–3: Two Sum, Product of Array Except Self, Rotate Array, Remove Duplicates → practice 2/day
* Days 4–7: Longest Substring Without Repeating, Minimum Window Substring, Group Anagrams, 3Sum → 1–2/day

Week 2 — Sliding Window / Monotonic / Stacks / Heaps

* Days 8–10: Sliding Window Maximum, Minimum Size Subarray Sum, Trapping Rain Water → 1/day
* Days 11–14: Valid Parentheses, Min Stack, Daily Temperatures, Kth Largest → 1/day

Week 3 — Linked Lists + Binary Search + Intervals + Greedy

* Days 15–17: Linked List Cycle, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Add Two Numbers, LRU → 1/day
* Days 18–20: Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Search in Rotated Array, Find Min in Rotated → 1/day
* Days 21: Merge Intervals, Non-overlapping Intervals, Gas Station → 2 problems

Week 4 — DP + Mock OAs + Reviews

* Days 22–24: Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Coin Change, LIS → 1/day
* Days 25–26: Word Break, Generate Parentheses, Word Search (if time)
* Days 27–28: 2 × timed mock OAs (HackerRank / LeetCode timed), re-solve weak problems
* Day 29: Practice explanation + whiteboard talk for 8 problems
* Day 30: Final review, re-solve 10 random problems in 45 min each

If you are extremely pressed, compress to 3 weeks by doing 3–4 problems/day with a higher baseline.

# 6) How to practice each problem (the fast, effective loop)

1. Read problem — 2 min. Ask clarifying assumptions (what about negatives, duplicates, empty inputs).
2. Think / Outline approach — 5–10 min. Write high-level plan and complexity.
3. Brute force idea — 3 min. Then optimize: pick pattern that applies.
4. Code — 20–30 min (timebox). Use clear variable names.
5. Run & test (edge cases) — 5–10 min. Add small fixes.
6. Explain aloud for 2–3 minutes as if interviewer asked.
7. Mark it: “solid / shaky / need revisit”. Revisit “shaky” within 48–72 hrs.

---

# 7) Repetition strategy (Pareto loop)

* **First pass**: learn approach & implement.
* **Second pass (48–72 hrs)**: re-solve without hints (timeboxed 25–35 min).
* **Weekly**: pick 6 past problems and re-solve in interview mode.
* **Monthly**: full mock OA + 1 mock interview.

This spaced repetition gives huge leverage: a few re-solves lock patterns into recall.

---

# 8) Interview readiness metrics (be honest)

You’re ready for intern-level OA/interview when you can:

* Solve \~80% of LeetCode **Medium** problems from this list in ≤45 minutes (including explaining).
* Finish a timed HackerRank-style OA (2 problems) within the time limit with passing tests.
* Explain your approach and complexity clearly in 2–3 minutes.
* Produce bug-free code for simple/medium problems in one sitting most of the time.

If you hit \~70–80% of these consistently in mocks → you’re in great shape.

---

# 9) Don’t forget the non-coding 20%

Pareto includes soft parts that produce outsized returns:

* **Behavioral prep (STAR)**: prepare 6–8 stories mapped to Amazon Leadership Principles.
* **Communication**: practice narrating approach out loud — interviewers grade clarity.
* **Code hygiene**: write readable variable names, handle edge cases, and give complexity.
* **OA skills**: know the platform (HackerRank), how to run tests, and how to debug fast.

---

# 10) If you want FAANG full-time (add-on)

After nailing the above, add the highest-ROI trees/graphs/advanced DP:

* Number of Islands (#200) — BFS/DFS flood-fill
* Lowest Common Ancestor (#236) / Construct Tree (#105) — tree fundamentals
* Course Schedule (#207) / Clone Graph (#133) / Word Ladder (#127) — graph BFS/Topo
* Advanced DP: Edit Distance (#72) & Palindromic Substrings (#647)

Spend 2–4 additional weeks on those if aiming at full-time FAANG.

---

# Final, practical checklist (actionable)

1. Master the **Top 20** above — do them until “solid.”
2. Use the 4-week plan: 1–2 problems/day, re-solve weekly.
3. Do 2 timed mock OAs before any real OA.
4. Prepare 6 STAR stories and practice explaining solutions.
5. Track readiness by the **readiness metrics** above.

Want me to:

* generate a **Top 20 clickable HTML** like you had earlier, or
* turn this into a **weekly calendar** you can copy into Google Calendar (with specific problems per day)?
